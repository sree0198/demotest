## Scenario
Your team just received a notification that the latest deployment failed. The deployment logs suggest that a recent commit introduced a bug causing the build to break. Your task is to inspect the Git repository, identify the bad commit, and revert to the last stable version.

## Objective
Find and roll back the commit that introduced the bug to restore a stable version of the application.

**NOTE:** Kindly ignore the github workflows file, no need to compile it for puzzle-1.
